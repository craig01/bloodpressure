# Blood Pressure

*bloodpressure* is a web server to practice building an application environment.

This initial configuration was based on the web site:
https://adamcod.es/2014/09/23/vagrant-ansible-quickstart-tutorial.html

phpMyAdmin was first attempted but was taking too much time for a simple
command of sudo apt-get install phpmyadmin when we needed it.

The MySQL database created is called 'pressure' and the table is called 'readings'
The user is root and no password *shock*
